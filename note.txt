mounted
In Vue.js, the mounted lifecycle hook is an important part of the component lifecycle.
It is called after the component has been created and inserted into the DOM.
This hook is useful for performing actions that require the component to be fully rendered, such as fetching data, manipulating the DOM, or initializing third-party libraries.

LocalStorage

The data remains even after the browser is closed and reopened.
